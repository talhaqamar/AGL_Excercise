# Programming challenge

A JSON web service has been set up at the url:
http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json


The Android project you're looking at has been set up as a very basic app which
makes a request to the above service and downloads the data.

Your task is to write code to process the downloaded data (HINT: Look for
`TODO` comments in the code) and output a list of only the cats, grouped under 
a heading of their owner's gender and sorted in alphabetical order.

Example:

* Male
    - Angel
    - Molly
    - Tigger

* Female
    - Gizmo
    - Jasper
    

Once you have parsed the data correctly, display it on screen in a list
resembling the above. 

Notes:


    - The provided project contains bugs, we expect you to fix them.
    - Assume there can be any number of genders.
    - Use industry best practices.
    - Use the code to showcase your skill.
